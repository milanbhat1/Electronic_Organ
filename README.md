# Electronic Organ Using Simple Transistors

## Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a compact, cost-effective **electronic organ** using basic components such as **transistors, resistors, and capacitors**. When a key is pressed, a specific frequency is generated to simulate a musical note, based on the Indian classical music scale (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni).

> No microcontrollers or integrated circuits — a fully analog organ built with discrete components.

## Objective

To develop a low-cost, educational electronic musical instrument that:
- Produces seven distinct musical tones
- Uses transistor-based oscillators for frequency generation
- Demonstrates principles of audio frequency oscillation and analog sound synthesis
- Serves as a learning platform for electronics and audio signal concepts

## Frequency Mapping

| Musical Note | Frequency (Hz) |
|--------------|----------------|
| Sa           | 240            |
| Re           | 270            |
| Ga           | 300            |
| Ma           | 320            |
| Pa           | 360            |
| Dha          | 400            |
| Ni           | 450            |

Each note is generated by pressing a button connected to a unique RC network, which alters the oscillator frequency accordingly.

## Methodology

1. **Oscillator Design**: RC-based transistor multivibrator configured per note.
2. **Input Control**: Push buttons act as keys to activate each oscillator circuit.
3. **Amplification**: Transistor-based amplification drives an 8Ω speaker.
4. **Frequency Tuning**: Fine-tuned with potentiometers and verified using an oscilloscope.
5. **Simulation**: Designed and tested using TINA simulation software.
6. **Implementation**: Built first on a breadboard, then soldered onto a PCB.
